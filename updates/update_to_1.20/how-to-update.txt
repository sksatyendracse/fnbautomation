How to update:

Open the folder 'updates/update_to_1.20' and upload the contents to your server. This folder contains only the modified files. If you have modified the templates, please read the information below to understand how you can upgrade and keep your template modifications.

If your current version is less than v.1.20, you first need to apply the previous update(s) in sequential order. For example, if you want to update from v.1.17 to v.1.20, you need to apply the update_to_1.18, then update_to_1.19 and after that, update_to_1.20, in this order.

==================================================
* Template files:
==================================================
Starting in version 1.18, Directoryapp supports child themes. If you have made template modifications and want to keep them, rename the modified template files by appending the '-child' suffix.

For example, if you edited the 'templates/tpl_index.php', rename it to 'templates/my_tpl_index.php'.
Another example, if you edited the 'templates/_header.php', rename it to 'templates/my_header.php'.

If you edited the styles.css file and want to keep the modifications, add the modified rules in a separate CSS file.
